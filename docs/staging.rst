Staging and parallelization
===========================


Example run
-----------

As an example, let's say that we want to perform the following null test on ACT data:
check that the debiased lensing power spectrum on a split null for
a specific individual array is consistent with zero.

This requires the following:

1. A mask to define the geometry and region of the test
2. Simulations
